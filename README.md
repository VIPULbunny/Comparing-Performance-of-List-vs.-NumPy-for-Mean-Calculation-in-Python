# Comparing-Performance-of-List-vs.-NumPy-for-Mean-Calculation-in-Python
This code snippet generates an array of 100 million random numbers using NumPy. It then calculates the mean of the array using both a Python list and NumPy's built-in mean() function, comparing the execution time of each method. Finally, the code prints the version of NumPy used.
